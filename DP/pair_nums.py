In a technical interview, you've been given an array of numbers and you need to find a pair of numbers that are equal to the given target value.
 Numbers can be either positive, negative, or both. Can you design an algorithm that works in O(n)â€”linear time or greater?

let sequence = [8, 10, 2, 9, 7, 5]
let results = pairValues(sum: 11) = //returns (9, 2)
