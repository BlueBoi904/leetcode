Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.



Example 1:


Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:


Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false


Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

"""


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def is_same_tree(p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:

    # Compare trees, if one node is not the same using dfs, return False

    # p and q are both None
    if not p and not q:
        return True
    # one of p and q is None
    if not q or not p:
        return False
    if p.val != q.val:
        return False
    return is_same_tree(p.right, q.right) and is_same_tree(p.left, q.left)
