2634. Filter Elements from Array
Easy
16
2
Write a function that takes an input array of integers arr and a filtering function fn and returns a new array with a fewer or equal number of elements.

The returned array should only contain elements where fn(arr[i], i) evaluated to a truthy value.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,10,20,30], fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:
const newArray = filter(arr, fn); // [20, 30]
The function filters out values that are not greater than 10
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function firstIndex(n, i) { return i === 0; }
Output: [1]
Explanation:
fn can also accept the index of each element
In this case, the function removes elements not at index 0
Example 3:

Input: arr = [-2,-1,0,1,2], fn = function plusOne(n) { return n + 1 }
Output: [-2,0,1,2]
Explanation:
Falsey values such as 0 should be filtered out
 

Constraints:

0 <= arr.length <= 1000
-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
