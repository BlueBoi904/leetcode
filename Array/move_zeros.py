"""

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1


Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
